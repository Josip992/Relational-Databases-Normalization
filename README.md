# Relational-Databases-Normalization
SQL seminar task from the 'SQL Practicum' course at University Department of Professional Studies


Given task: Develop an application that will store relational schemas and sets of functional dependencies within those schemas, and allow for viewing and/or deleting entered sets of functional dependencies and schemas, as well as adding new ones. Each schema should contain at least ten attributes and a minimum of five functional dependencies. The application must have at least five examples entered before the seminar review by the professor. The application should offer the ability to select a relational schema (with its set of functional dependencies) and then find its primary keys. By selecting one of these primary keys, the application should enable decomposition into Third Normal Form (3NF) and decomposition into Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF). Along with the result, provide an adequate explanation, the process, and all steps of the applied decomposition algorithm. The application can be implemented in any programming language/tool/technology, with the note that the environment must support executing the application and reviewing the code during the defense of the seminar paper.
